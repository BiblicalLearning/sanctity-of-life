## 📖 About This Study

This study is designed to accomplish two vital purposes:

1. **Teach the Truth** - What Scripture clearly says about life in the womb, the image of God, and why abortion is wrong
2. **Offer Healing** - Compassionate, gospel-centered hope for those who've had abortions

Every life is precious. Every sin is forgivable. Every heart can be healed.

## 💚 A Note on Tone

This study holds both **truth AND grace** together - just as Jesus did (John 1:14). It doesn't shy away from calling abortion what it is, but it also doesn't condemn those who've experienced it. The goal is biblical clarity paired with gospel compassion.
